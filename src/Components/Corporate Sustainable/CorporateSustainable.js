            Since 2011 from grass roots local environmental projects, to global
            consulting, to the biggest of international companies, TWAC has
            shown its clients how to implement and be rewarded for visible and
            genuine protection of profits, people and the planet; the elusive
            triple bottom line.

            There is a huge difference between sustainable development and
            pretending to being sustainable, so called “greenwashing”. The
            community, which includes your customers, are wise to fake
            sustainability efforts, and the evidence is that false
            sustainability promotion is more damaging to a company’s reputation
